# OpenClaw Environment Configuration
# Generated by create-openclaw-agent.
#
# IMPORTANT: API keys are stored in your cloud's Secret Manager.
# On the VM, the startup script fetches secrets and generates this file
# into tmpfs (RAM-only). You should never need to edit keys here manually.
#
# To rotate a key:
#   1. Update in Secret Manager (see docs/gcp-guide.md)
#   2. Reboot the VM or run: ~/openclaw-restart.sh
